# CV Adaptation Guide

Rules for tailoring Andrew's CV while maintaining authenticity.

## Core Principles

1. **Never fabricate** - Only emphasize existing experience, never invent
2. **Reframe, don't rewrite** - Adjust emphasis and framing, preserve facts
3. **Subtle keywords** - Integrate naturally, avoid keyword stuffing
4. **Maintain voice** - Keep Andrew's authentic tone

## Profile Adaptation

The profile is the highest-impact section. Adapt by:

### Lead with relevance
Reorder sentences to front-load experience most relevant to the role.

**Example - AI/ML role:**
> Lead with Unobravo AI companion work, Cleo AI experience, FanDuel predictive/personalization work

**Example - Scale-up leadership:**
> Lead with team scaling (7→50 at FanDuel), org building, culture work

**Example - Mental health/regulated industry:**
> Lead with Unobravo's trust-heavy regulated context, Trustpilot's consumer trust platform

### Adjust emphasis words
Use `<strong>` tags strategically for company names most relevant to role.

### Closing hook
Tailor the "My focus is..." sentence to mirror role priorities.

## Strengths Adaptation

Reorder the 5 strengths to lead with most relevant. Never remove or add - only reorder.

Current strengths:
1. Building and scaling design organisations across disciplines
2. Leading AI-driven and data-informed product design
3. Creating clarity, autonomy, and strong collaboration in teams
4. Mentoring design leaders and startup founders
5. Translating insight into product and organisational strategy

**For AI-focused roles:** Lead with #2
**For leadership/VP roles:** Lead with #1
**For strategy roles:** Lead with #5
**For culture/people roles:** Lead with #3

## Experience Adaptation

### Achievement reordering
Within each role, reorder bullet points to lead with most relevant achievements. Never delete achievements - only reorder.

### Keyword integration
Where truthful, adjust phrasing to include role keywords:
- "design system" ↔ "design systems"
- "AI-first" ↔ "AI-native" ↔ "AI-driven"
- "product strategy" ↔ "strategic product work"

### Subtitle emphasis
The subtitle under each role can be lightly adjusted to emphasize relevant aspects.
