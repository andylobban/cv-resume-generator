# Profile
# =============================================================================

profile: |
  <p>Product and design leader with over twenty years building and scaling products in high-growth technology companies. I've led product strategy and execution across startups, scale-ups, and global organisations - from <strong>FanDuel</strong>'s US multi-brand sports ecosystem to <strong>Trustpilot</strong>'s global marketplace, <strong>Cleo</strong>'s AI-first financial app, and now <strong>Unobravo</strong>'s European mental health platform and global AI companion app.</p>
  <p>My background combines product leadership with deep design expertise, giving me a distinctive edge in creating products that balance innovation with clarity, growth with trust, and speed with quality. I've driven double-digit growth, scaled teams from 7 to 50+, and led cross-functional strategy at executive level.</p>
  <p>I'm focused on how product evolves in an AI-driven world: building products that are human, trusted, and commercially successful while embracing the new possibilities AI brings. I'm open to full time, fractional, consulting, and advisory.</p>
