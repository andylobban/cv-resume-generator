# Profile
# =============================================================================

profile: |
  <p>Product development leader with over twenty years in technology, including ten years leading cross-functional teams and shaping how product, design, and engineering work together. I've built and scaled product organisations from 7 to 50+ people, introduced operating models that drive alignment and autonomy, and led strategic initiatives accountable to executive teams across startups, scale-ups, and global organisations.</p>
  <p>My background combines direct leadership of product and design with deep engineering partnership on complex technical products - from <strong>FanDuel</strong>'s multi-platform sports ecosystem to <strong>Trustpilot</strong>'s global marketplace, <strong>Cleo</strong>'s AI-first financial app, and now <strong>Unobravo</strong>'s European mental health platform and AI companion. I bring a distinctive perspective on product development: how to maintain quality, trust, and coherence while shipping at pace.</p>
  <p>I'm focused on how product development evolves in an AI-driven world: building organisations and products that are human, trusted, and commercially successful. I'm open to full time, fractional, consulting, and advisory.</p>
